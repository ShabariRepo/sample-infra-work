-- this is the docker-file to start nexus
- few things to consider:
check for any proxies
-- if there are proxies then you will need to add a line in the script
   to set them off or set the ENV to proxy IP given its outgoing
-- if the server is on an isolated subnet you will need to add the
   any ack parties to the ip-routing to allow for communication to
   both host server and container itself
